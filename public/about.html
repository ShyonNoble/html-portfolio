<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>My name is Shyon Felix Noble(23), and let me tell you about myself and my journey of becoming a Web developer.</p>

<p>I have lived in New Plymouth for a majority of my life, here on this on-going and ever-unpredicting world. When i was young, i lived with my solo-father, in which he took the role of being my main figure of motivation and my teacher of life. Teaching me important values and strong moral principles throughtout my childhood. Some of these values that I continue to live by today; 
<ul>
  <li>Love</li>
  <li>Respect</li>
  <li>Gratitude</li>
  <li>Strength</li>
  <li>Survival</li>
</ul>
These are only some of the many values that he taught me, but I would consider the main one's we lived by daily. So I wanted to show gratitude and thank my father for molding the person I am today.</p>

<p>I attended primary at St Joseph New Plymouth (year 1-6), then secondary/highschool at Francis Douglas Memorial College, gratuading year 13 in 2017, which i obtained NCEA Levels 1 & 2. My favourite subjects were Music and drama. I attended 3 school productions and out of school productions, auditioned for a film through my association of the drama company WCYT (West Coast Youth Theatre) ran by the beautiful <a href="http://theproactors.co.nz/actors/holly-shanahan/">Holly Shanahan</a>. I was a bass player for the school jazz band travelling away for jazz compititions held in Waikato and filmed productions with my close friends for school presentations. During my last year of highschool, i studied through gateway CPP (Careers Pathway Program) gaining work skills instead of formal education. I attended <a href="https://www.witt.ac.nz/">WITT</a>, a local polytech in New Plymouth studing and gaining skills in hospitaltiy, food and beverage, running a cafe within the facility and providing, lunch and dinner service whilst doing 1 day a week of work experiance at Gusto Restuarant LTD.</p>

<p>Fresh out of highschool, I got offered a job at Gusto Restuarant in December which i had worked for 4 1/2 years as a junior to senior front of house wait staff, bartender & barista. after some time, i felt i needed to get out of the comfort of one place and finally decided to move onto another restuarant, Arborio. I spent 6 months there. This was my last job in the hospitality industry before moving on to work at Van Dykes Fine Foods, a pancake factory based in Bellblock, a subtown just outside of New Plymouth. Which I spent a year working as a Line 1 cook (2 different rooms, cooking differnet types of pancakes) promoted upto Line leader/ 2IC. Before you know it, I had finally come to a massive decision that would really change my life. Taking time off for my well-being.</p>

<p>I'd been off work for 7-8 months due to personal life, grief of my father's passing re-surfacing, which was unfortunate to experiance at the age of 16 and many challenges that brought upon negative health decisions, depression & anxiety. From extrovert to introvert, it was finally time to decide to take the time for myself and my health, and most importantly, self-healing. Now, I've overcome many of those challenges with self-improvement, healing, healthier choices, and couldn't be happier with the choice I made to take time to, just. slow. down. This is still an on-going journey and I love it! Motivated and determined more than ever, I've had the oppertunitiy to join the team at Proformac Technologies and endeavor a 6 month IT course and learn web development through <a href="https://www.learnerme.ac.nz/">Learner.me</a>. The best decision i've made in order to get into the work force, but with qualifications and a self-managing routine to ensure further self-development and getting myself work ready. It's hard for one to admit struggle, but for one to embrace it, and embody the strength through Love and Gratitude to conquer these hard times. It allows us as an individual to predict future trails and tribulations with a much more clear understanding.  So, I dont write this text out of sympathy for me, but as motivation to those who might have experianced or are experiancing similar tribulations. No matter your situation, no matter what challenges are ahead of you, no matter how claustrophobic life might feel, to never be afraid to take time for yourself to just figure things out. Doesn't matter how long, how less it might take you. NEVER compare yourself to others and their healing journey because we are all a special indiviual put on this earth for a reason and to live it our way. Trust in your intuition, trust your fellings, feel your body calling for help, these are our feelings and embrace the bad, as good will come of it in its due time. Most importantly, LOVE YOURSELF! so we don't LOSE ourself ever again and if we do, the task won't be as hard as the first time, and things will get easier.</p>

<p>But if you have made it this far, then i commemorate you and want to show gratitude for you as the reader, taking the time to know my story. So, Thank you.</p>

<p>Love, Shyon.</p>
