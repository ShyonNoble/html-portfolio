<h1>The Best Movies According to Shyon</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1: Sam Raimi's 2002 film: Spiderman</h3>
<p>Not only based of nostalgia, but this film was my childhood. This film is recognised for my on-going love for spiderman and I hold a deep appreication for the series. Thank you to the Legend for the creation of my favourite superhero, Stan Lee.</p>
<h3>2: 1972 film: The Way of the Dragon (bruce Lee) </h3>
<p>Who doesn't love the Bruce Lee films!? Purely for the action and the underline lessons within the context of the film.</p>
<h3>3: 1995 film: Friday</h3>
<p>Black Humour. Comedy is Legendary. Always a movie that needs to be revisited yearly.</p>
